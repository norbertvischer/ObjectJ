        <H4><ul>
                <li>The ".ojj" project file is now saved in compressed binary format, not xml. This is much faster and files are much smaller.
                    It is still possible to export the project in the old xml format.
                    Old projects still can be loaded, but older versions of ObjectJ will not recognize the newer binary format.
                </li>
                <li>Project file now has an embedded macro set. With older versions, it was necessary to supply an
                    accompanying macro file with the same base name. If older projects are opened, that external macro will
                    automatically be recognized and embedded, i.e it will become part of the .ojj file when being saved.<br/>
                </li>
                <li>Importing macro text currently only works only via menu "Show Embedded Macros" and Copy-Paste. The macro set will be installed and embedded
                    via the button "Install under ObjectJ menu".
                </li>


                <li>New menu Command ObjectJ> Project File> Save an Empty Copy allows to transfer macros, object definitions, column names etc to a new project.

        <H4>
            <ul>
                <li>In previous versions, the ObjectJ results table as well as the columns settings could stop to respond
                    to user actions. This was a non-reproducible bug, which now hopefully is fixed due to synchronizing threads.
                </li> <li> Fixed a cosmetic bug  that appeared in OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and later, where buttons in the ObjectJ tools
                    window lost their "Selected" appearance when e.g selecting an image window.
                </li> <li> Fixed a bug that would not delete "All Objects in Current Image/Slice" when image was not shown at 100% zoom

        <H4>
            <ul>
                <li> Thanks to Wayne Rasband, ImageJ 1.43f recognizes project files with the .ojj extension:
                    opening a project file will automatically load the ObjectJ plugin. You now can drag an .ojj file
                    onto ImageJ's microscope icon.
                    Further, project files are double-clickable if you associate the ".ojj" extension to ImageJ (see
                    <a href="5-Concept.html" name="Tips">Concept+Tips</a>).

                    Unfortunately, some PC users complained about virus alerts, athough this is not a virus.
                    If your computer still shows a virus alert, it is because the old content is still in the cache.
                    The statcounter script was visible at the bottom of the "Home" or "Tutorial" html code. It is now removed.
